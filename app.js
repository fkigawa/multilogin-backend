/*
Express is a framework that streamlines the HTTP calls within this web application.

The packages described below are used as middleware to help structure the data in desired ways:
Path clarifies the path within the given directory to make sure calls are being made to the correct paths.
Body-Parser structures the data so that it can be read in expected ways.
Cors works to ensure that requests from the client are coming from who they say they are, by allowing but checking cross-origin requests

Mongoose connects the web application to the MongoDB database
